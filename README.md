# MechaCar Statistical Analysis
## Project Overview
The current project was conducted for the client AutosRUs, whose newest prototype (the MechaCar) is suffering from production troubles. The purpose of these analyses was to provide insights to help the manufacturing team. In addition, a statistical study was designed to compare the MechaCar performance to that of competing vehicles from other manufacturers.
